based on the first question, it can be concluded that in competitive programming all you expected to have is ability to solve a problem, you need to find the pattern like it's a puzzle then wrote it in a code.

aku memang belum bisa, tapi aku mau bisa, jangan give up dulu yuk bisa, it's gonna be worth it!
Imagine aku bisa, imagine jika aku tidak menyerah: i could participate in hackhaton, my ability to solve coding problem is crazy, my IQ could be higher than how it was, and most importantly i could get money from the contest or doing a paid lecture.
